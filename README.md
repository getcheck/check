## Introduction
Check Protocol is a next-generation trust layer based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) with anonymous verifiable credentials.

In the Web3 space, we often talk about blockchain becoming mainstream and being used beyond just finance, but it hasn’t really happened yet. SSI could be that trojan horse, getting corporations to more widely use Web3 technology.

Identity is the core function of trust relationships between physical individuals, things, or any forms of legal entities like businesses, organisations, DAO, and governments.

And we really believe that we are ready to provide the solution that will allow everyone in our protocol to have that identity without a large barrier to entry.

## Problem
### DeFi can't stay without KYC/AML for long
Since DeFi platforms are expanding their use horizons, the FATF has an unyielding determination to disallow further operations of exchanges and DeFi platforms without KYC/AML.

### Access to personal data by third parties
Personal data is the oil of the 21st century, companies are aggregating gigantic amounts of personal data, with scant attention to safety, more to sales and improvement of their artificial intelligences.

### Prove while staying anonymous
Not every service can be provided to every individual. The company requests additional verification and data to give you access to the required service. This incurs more costs for development and compatibility with regulatory laws (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA).


## Solution
Check Protocol provides transparent and permissionless trust tech stack for the Web3 and Web2 spaces.

### Features

- **Self-sovereign identity** - Verifiable credentials. Permissionless.
- **Authenticity oracle for DeFi/DAO** - Allows projects to verify and authorize their users without collecting/storing personal data.
- **End-to-end principle & encryption** - Private data is not collected anywhere and cannot be decrypted.
- **Full power of decentralization** - Solana-based registry. Decentralized communication on Libp2p.
- **A decentralized identifier (DID)** - A new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.
- **Selective disclosure of personal data** - Revealing users' identities based on their preferences.

## Roadmap

- [x] Smart contract registries
- [x] Base classes: claim type, claim, credential, attestation, request attestation
- [x] Wallet with asymmetric encrypting
- [x] On-chain verification
- [ ] DID integration
- [ ] Delegations
- [ ] Refactor & docs

Check Protocol is in active development, so all APIs are subject to change.
